# Sectored Langauge
Previously called MAS (Modular Alias Sectored), 
the first two are not as prevalent and the main feature of the language is really just
the sectorization concept for symbols.



An experimental langauge for figuring out stuff I wanted in langauges

I have tried serveral different ways to break down the langauge this is around my fith attempt.

The point of Sector was to see if it was possible to make a langauge that achieved the following goals:
1. Model a langauge where program structure modularity was a main priority.
2. Provide a language syntax that is similar and practical to use across different language translation platforms (LTPs)
3. Isolate features into language feature layers (policy contextes) to make comprehension and convention explicitly enforced in a flexible manner.
4. Program structure and build specification can be controlled per project via the build and UX toolchain.
5. Setup the infrastructure to support high coherency between the language toolchain and the user expereince for editing and debugging the program's source translation or run-time execution
  
  
My goal is to make a prototype that at least a prototype that covers goals 1, 2, and 3.
