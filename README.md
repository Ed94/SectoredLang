# Sectored Langauge

An experimental langauge for figuring out stuff I wanted in langauges

The main feature is that specific nodes in the language called **sectors** can be stacked with another.
This stacking can happen with a flexible degree of freedom to allow a large amount of freedom in expression.

The design of the langauge also makes it simple to render the ast as gui elements instead of text.

This project has a dedicated IDE for figuring out the langauge and a non-text based UI for it.
